  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p> Sunday afternoon at the local supermarket is a bustling place. Shoppers cut each other off for the last jar of salsa with a smile and a 'pardon me'. 
    Amid the somewhat friendly and mostly competitive crowd, long-time friends Yuri and Kalo bump into each other in front of the cauliflower. 
    It's always a bit awkward looking into someone else's shopping cart (feels like a violation of privacy, right?), but Yuri couldn't help but notice
    that there was some overlap. </p>

  <p>
    "Hey, I like rice cakes, too. Look!" exclaimed Yuri holding up a bag of rice cakes from his cart.
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
    "Oh, I hate them! Those are for my mom," replied Kalo. Yuri frowned.
  </p>-->

  <p>
    Anyway... the two carts looked like this:

<subsection xml:id="subsec-sets">
  <title>Collections of Things</title>
  
    
  <p> There's some mathematics going on here. Anytime we find a collection of items (like a shopping cart) we have a mathematical object called a set. </p>
  <definition> A <term>set</term> is simply a collection
of objects that we refer to as <term>elements</term>.</definition> 

<p> Let's call the set of Yuri's cart <m>Y</m>, written as 
<m> Y  = </m> { rice cakes, cauliflower, halibut, coffee creamer, spicy ramen, cilantro, yellow onion, corn chips, salami, eggs } . Similarly <m> K = </m> {rice cakes, cauliflower, tuna, crab legs, spicy ramen, parsley, purple onion, cookies, bagels, salami, and cream cheese} is the set representing Kalo's cart. So halibut
is an element of <m>Y</m> (written as halibet <m>\in Y</m>), and tuna <m> \in K</m>.

  </p>

  <p>
    We could make a list of the items that both Yuri and Kalo have in their carts, and this
     overlap between their two carts represents the "intersection of Y and K", denoted <m> Y \cap K</m>.</p>
    
  <definition>  In general for sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the <term> intersection of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> </term>, <m>A \cap B</m>, is the set of elements in both sets.

    <title>Yuri and Kalo's intersection</title>

    <p>
      What does <m> Y \cap K </m> contain?    </p>

      <p>
        <m> Y \cap K </m> = {rice cakes, cauliflower, spicy ramen, salami}

</question>

<p>
  Another friend interrupts Yuri and Kalo's meeting. JACOBI greets them both as they unapologetically rifle through his cart.
</p>

<p>
  JACOBI's cart is represented by the set <m>J = </m>  {spicy ramen, cilantro, corn chips, and eggs}. Yuri can't help notice that everything in <m>J</m> is also in <m>Y</m>. In this case,
we say that <m>J</m> is a subset of <m>Y</m>, denoted <m>J \subseteq Y</m> or <m>Y \supseteq J</m>. </p>

  <solution>
    <p>
      The subset we're looking for must be a set of dairy items in Kalo's cart: <m>D \cap K</m>, for example.

    <p>
      That is, <m>D \cap K = </m> {cream cheese}.

<p>
  Unbeknownst to Kalo, Kalo's wife MARNIE is also in the grocery store with <m>M = </m> {cauliflower, macaroni, purple onion, water, bacon}. When Kalo and MARNIE bump into each other, they decide
to finish their shopping and to consolidate their items to one cart. Kalo reshelves the cauliflower and purple onion, though, since MARNIE already has those items in her cart. This new cart is 
known as the "union of K and M", <m>K \cup M </m>. </p>

      In general, for sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, <m>A \cup B</m>, is the collection of elements that are in either set (or both).

<subsection xml:id="subsec-emptyset">
  <title>An empty cart</title>
  <p>
    After Kalo and Marnie consolidate their carts, somebody snags Kalo's now empty cart. This 
    makes Kalo consider how an empty cart relates to sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    
  </p>

  <question xml:id="q-emptyset">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Can a set have 0 elements?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Definitely!
      </p>
    </solution>
  </question>

  <p>
    Actually, that empty cart is symbolic of a very important set. The <term>empty set</term>
    is the set with no elements. We denote it as <m>\phi</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    
  </p>

  <question xml:id="q-emptyinter">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Give an example of two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> for which
        <m>A \cap B = \phi</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are millions of examples. For example, let <m>A</m> be the set of
        all species of turtles and <m>B</m> be the set of flying creatures. Come up
        with your on example.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-venn">
  <title>Venn Diagrams</title>
  
  <p>
    A common way to picture sets and how they interact is with overlapping circles. You have already seen a few such images in this section. We call these
    figures Venn diagrams, named after mathematician John Venn (1834-1923), and they help us quickly recognize how given sets
    are related.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, consider the sets <m>A = \{\text{all primes}\}</m>, <m>B = \{\text{odds less than} 10\}</m>, and
    <m>C = \{\text{divisors of }\}30</m>. Are sets such as <m>A \cap B</m> or <m>B \cup C</m> obvious? The Venn diagram
    makes these relationships obvious.

    <p>
    
    </p>

  <question xml:id="q-venn1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the Venn diagram to provide <m>A \cap B \cap C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We can see <m>A \cap B \cap C =  \{3,5\}</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </question>

    It's also fairly common to find Venn diagram memes. You should do a quick
    internet search to see for yourself.

    Remember that our goal is to introduce you to topics you'll cover in more detail later. There are other set operations that we won't cover here. 
    You'll see these in classes like Discrete Mathematics, Modern Algebra, and many others.

    <title>Set Activities</title>

    <activity xml:id="act-set1">
      <title>Human Venn Diagrams</title>
      <p>
        Your class will now be a human Venn diagram (This works best in an open area). Each of you will
        receive an idex card. On your index card, write (1) an integer, (2) a color, and (3) an animal. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, your card may include
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              73
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              tangerine
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              pangolin.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Your instructor will designate one part of the room (or area) for set <m>A</m>, another for
        set <m>B</m>, and a third area for set <m>C</m>. </p>
      <p>
        Now for the game. Your instructor will call out (or write on the board) what the three
        sets represent. At that point, you must move to the location on the Venn diagram that fits your card.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, suppose your instructor calls out (or writes) "<m>A</m> is the set even integers, <m>B</m> is 
        the set of warm colors (yellows, oranges, reds), and <m>C</m> is the set of predatory animals. Compare those
        sets to your card. It appears <m>C</m> is the only set you are a part of, so move on to that section of the Venn
        diagram. The quicker, the better.
      </p>

        Play a few rounds.

    </activity>

    <activity xml:id="act-set2">
      <title>Crafting Sets</title>
      
      <p>
        For this activity, the class will be divided groups. The instructor will give either an element or a set of elements as well as
        a set operator (either union or intersection). The group is challenged to find two sets whose union or intersection (whichever is 
        specified) is the given element or subset.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, suppose your instructor says "<m>\{3,5,6,9,10,12,15,\ldots \}</m> and <m>\cup</m>". Your
        group could let <m>A = \{\text{ multiples of }3\}</m> and <m>B = \{\text{ multiples of }5\}</m> since <m>A \cup B = \{3,5,6,9,10,12,15,\ldots \}</m>.
