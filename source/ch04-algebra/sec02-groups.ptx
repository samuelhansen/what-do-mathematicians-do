    Imagine a game board with four squares (like a <m>1 \times 4</m> chessboard)
    labelled <m>0</m> through <m>3</m>, and one token placed on a square. This is
    a rather simple game, all we can do is move the token to the right, and if 
    the token moves off the board, it goes back to spot <m>0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
   We can map out all possible moves of this game with a simple chart. We'll
   write <m>a + b</m> to mean the token starts in slot <m>a</m> and travels
   <m>b</m> moves to the right.

    This game is rather boring... is it even a game? But it illustrates how we can

        <p>
          If we ever make contact with an extraterrestrial society, how
          could we ever hope to communicate with them? We think that mathematics
          is our best chance of communicating with intelligent life. We are pretty
          confident that if they have the means to send and receive messages, they
          will have an understanding of mathematics.
      </p> 

      <p>
        But what does their alien math look like? We would be very suprised to find
        the Mean Value Theorem or the Four Color Theorem in their writings, right? At least with
        the same phrasing we use, BUT we would not be surprised if they had their own
        versions of these results.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modern algebra seeks to explore "deeper" structures of mathematical systems,
          so that we can recognize familiar math in unfamiliar environments. Can we find 
          the big picture patterns of mathematics? That is our goal with higher algebra.

      Do you notice any similarities between <xref ref="table-token1"/> and ? 
      Tables like these are called <term>Cayley Tables</term>, and one use of Cayley
      Tables is highlighting patterns. Even though we have different contexts,
      different sets, and even different operations, in some way they are the 
      same thing.

    <p>
      Algebraists can show that the context of the token on the chessboard
      and the multiplicative powers of <m>i</m> are, in fact, the same. What 
      we mean, actually, is that they operate the same way. We say they are
      <term>isomorphic </term> (meaning "same shape"), and in an 
      algebra course we can prove these things are isomorphic.

      <title>What is a Group?</title>
      <subsubsection><title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Both of the previous examples are examles of one of the simplest 
        algebraic structures: the <term>group</term>. We have found two groups,
        so far, and highlighted that they are isomorphic, but what exactly
        is a group?
      </p>

      <p>
        The group <m>G</m> is a set paired with an operation (let's say <m>\ast</m>) that satisfies
        a short list of properties. The first two are familar to us.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              the <term>closure property:</term> if <m>a, b \in G</m>, then <m>a \ast b \in G.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the <term>associative property:</term> for any <m>a,b,c \in G</m>, <m>(a \ast b) \ast c = a \ast (b \ast c)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
                    
        </ol> 
       
      </p>

      <p>
        To show the last two properties, let's consider the two examples we discussed
        earlier. Let <m>A</m> be paired with multiplication as earlier, and let <m>B = \{0,1,2,3\}</m> be paired with addition
        defined by such: the token starting at square <m>a</m> moving <m>b</m> squares to the right will rest on 
      square <m>a + b = c</m>.

          How is a number affected when multiplied by <m>1</m>? What about when
          summed with <m>0</m>? 
        </p>

        <p>
         By using the Caylet Tables from earlier, we can see in set <m>A</m>, there is an element, <m>e</m>,
          so that for any other element <m>a \in A</m>, <m>a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a</m>. In other words,
          multiplying by <m>e</m> changes nothing. An element like <m>e</m> is known as the
          <term>identity</term> of <m>G</m>.

        <p>
          The third property of groups is that every group has an <term>identity</term>.

        <p>
          Consider the token game once again, and suppose we start on square <m>0</m> and move <m>3</m> spaces to right to end up on 
          square <m>3</m>. Can we make another move to end up back on square <m>0</m>?
          In general, if we start on square <m>0</m> and move <m>b</m> squares to the right. We can only move right, but is it possible
          to keep moving right until we end up back on square <m>0</m>?

              After moving <m>a</m> squares, starting at square <m>0</m>, determine how many squares you must traverse

              Similarly, we travel <m>2</m> squares and <m>1</m> square respectively for <m>a = 2, 3</m> respectively.

            So for any square <m>a</m>, there is a number of squares <m>b</m> that results in landing on square <m>0</m>. In other words,
            for any <m>a \in B</m>, there is a <m>b \in B</m> where <m>a + b = 0</m>. In this case, we say <m>b</m> is the <term>inverse</term>
            of <m>a</m>. Remember that <m>0</m> serves a special role in <m>B</m>: the identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The last property of group is the <term>inverse property</term>. That is, for any <m>g \in G</m>, there is an element <m>h \in G</m>,
            where <m>g \ast h = h \ast g = e</m>, where <m>e</m> is the identity of <m>G</m>. In other words, starting with

      <title>Why do we think about groups?</title>

      <p>
        If we can prove a statement about a generic group <m>G</m>, then
        we know that statement will apply to any group we find! Knowing things
        about groups will help us find the familiar patterns in unfamiliar 
        environments. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So proving a statement about a group <m>G</m> proves statements in
        an many different contexts (sometimes an infinite number of contexts). Thinking
        in generalized terms is a powerful way to approach math, and mathematicians
        like to generalize for that very reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, here are some things we know about groups.

      <title>A Group of Squares</title>

      <p>
        Let's look at one last example of a group. Take a square with corners
        labelled <m>a, b, c,d</m> (We would recommend cutting one out of paper), and 
        we will say a "symmetry" of the square is an action in which we 
        pick up the square, do something to it, and put it down again so that
        it takes up the same space it did before. For example, we can rotate the
        square <m>90^{\circ}</m>, and it will rest on the exact same space where it started.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are eight symmetries of the square. Can you find them?
      </p>

      <question xml:id="ques-dihedral1">
        <statement>
          <p>
            What are the eight basic symmetries of the square?
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            There are four rotations: rotating <m>0^{\circ}</m>, <m>90^{\circ}</m>,
            <m>180^{\circ}</m>, <m>270^{\circ}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also four flips: flip along a horizontal axis, along a vertical axis,
            along a northwest diagonal, and along a northeast diagonal.
          </p>
        </solution>
        
      </question>

      <p>
        Let's call this set of symmetries <m>D = \{I, R_1, R_2, R_3, F_h, F_v, F_{NW}, F_{NE}\}</m>. Here,
        we call a rotation of <m>0^{\circ}</m> <m>I</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        FIGURE
      </p>

      <p>
        What if we did two of these symmetries? Do we get something new? For symmetries
        <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>, the composition <m>\alpha \circ \beta</m> is the result
        of first applying <m>\beta</m> and then applying <m>\alpha</m>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, <m>R_1 \circ R_2</m> means we first rotate the square <m>180^{\circ}</m> 
        and then another <m>90^{\circ}</m>. Is this a new symmetry? No... it's just <m>R_3</m>. Are 
        any of them new?
