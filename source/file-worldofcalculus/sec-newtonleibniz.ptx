  <title>Newton vs Leibniz</title>
<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

  <p> Calculus is arguably the greatest human discovery of all time. With calculus, we have
    significantly increased our understanding of classical physics, electromagnetism, 
    population dynamics, and astronomy. Every text message you send was made possible
    through calculus. Every time you take a Tylenol, pump your car breaks, or listen to the radio, you
    are expierencing gifts of calculus. Applications of calculus
    affect our daily lives in profound ways.</p>

    <p>
      The calculus we have today packaged in nice textbooks is due to the hard work and 
      incredible insight of a lot of incredibly impressive people. Famous mathematicians like
      Fermat, Descartes, and Archimedes all laid ground work for modern calculus, but the lion's share
      of the credit often goes to two giants in the mathematical world: Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the story of Newton and Leibniz is not without controversy.

      <p>
        Considered to be one of the three greatest mathematical minds of all time, Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727)
        expressed a generational talent for science and mathematics. He is referred to as a 
        "supreme genius" and was England's champion of science.

          <p>
            There are several. One example of Newton's contributions is in the area of optics.

      <title>Leibniz</title>

      <p>
        Just because you're not a generational super genius like Isaac Newton does not
        mean that you cannot make significant contributions to the scientific community. During the
        time of Newton, German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), also developed
        calculus. More than that, Leibniz is known for his contributions to philosophy, ethics, politics,
        and library organizational systems.

       <p>
        Actually, Leibniz also developed today's standard notation for derivatives and integrals, and his 
        approach to the subject more closely resembles what we do today over Newton's calculus.
       </p>

       <p>
        Not only that, Leibniz developed our understanding of base-2 number systems: binary. At the
        machine level, computers operate through binary mathematics. We can thank Leibniz for that.

    <title>The Calculus Controversy </title>

    <p>
      Who should get credit for the discovery of modern calculus? You might think it would be easy to share 
      credit, but that is not the way European nations thought of things in the 17th century. Calculus'
      discovery became a huge source of conflict, and this conflict quickly pitted Newton and
      Leibniz against each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gotthegist's YouTube video, "The Calculus Controversy", tells this story well. Watch the video and
      answer the following questions.

  <question xml:id="q-nvl1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        What did Newton call his version of calculus?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </question>
  <question xml:id="q-nvl2">
    <statement>

        What notation did Leibniz introduce?

  <question xml:id="q-nvl3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        When did Leibniz publish his calculus? What about Newton?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </question>
  <question xml:id="q-nvl4">
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is an infinitesmal?

  </question>
  <question xml:id="q-nvl5">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Who ran a smear campaign in the quest to get credit for campus? Was
        it successful?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </question>
  <question xml:id="q-nvl6">
    <statement>
      <p>
        What brand of calculus has stuck around?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </question>

  <p>
    Thankfully, the world has mostly moved on from the drama of the origins of
    calculus. We can simply enjoy the fruit of their labor. Regardless of the story,
    we should be thankful that Newton and Leibniz both get credit today.
