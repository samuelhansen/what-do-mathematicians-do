  <title>Archimedes' Great Idea</title>
<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

  <p> Modern Calculus was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton and Gotfriend Leibniz in 1687. But the great mathematician, Archimedes, was really close to developing Calculus in 300 B.C. 
    (Almost 2000 years before Newton and Leibniz!) with the formation of the limit: the
   starting point of well-defined calculus (though he never used the word ``limit" in his construction.).  </p>

    <title>What is this weird number?</title>

    <p>
        To illustrate how Archimedes was thinking about calculus two thousand years before
        calculus was a known thing, we should think about circles. Ancient cultures were puzzled that every circle 
        carried an unusual trait. It seemed that for a circle with diameter <m>d</m>, its circumference
        was predictable... kind of.
    </p>

        <title>Circumference and Diameter</title>       
        
        <p>
            How many diameter lengths is the circumference of a circle? 
            SETUP SOME ACTIVITY WITH THIS.

    <p>
        It appears that a circle with diamer <m>d</m> has a circumference a bit more than 
        <m>3d</m>. This fact was true with every circle, and each culture attempted by their
        own estimates to calculate the myserious number that was the ratio of circumference to diameter <m>c/d</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So what is this number? We define
         <m>\pi</m> as <m>c/d</m> for the circle with circumference <m>c</m> and 
         diameter <m>d</m>. The Babylonians found <m>3.125</m> to approximate <m>\pi</m>, and the Egyptians
         used <m>3.1605</m> for their estimate. You probably learned something like <m>3.14</m>. Through modern techniques,
         computers can now calculate <m>\pi</m> to millions of digits, but the true value of <m>\pi</m> eluded the 
         greatest of minds for centuries.
    </p>

    <p>
        For reference, here are the first 30 digits of <m>\pi</m>.

        <me>
        \pi \approx 3.14159265358979323846264338327

    <title>Archimedes' Estimate</title>

    <p>
        Archimedes was interested in figuring out the very mysterious number of <m>\pi</m>, and eventually 
        estimated <m>\pi</m> to be <m>21/7 \leq \pi \leq 210/71</m> (or between <m>3.1408 \text{ and } 3.1429</m>). 
        That's really, really close for 300 BC.
    </p>

    <p>
        How did he develop such a good estimate? Archimedes was exteremly good at
        calculations, and he knew polygons very well.  
    </p>

    <p>
        He first inscribed a hexagon in a circle with radius <m>1</m> like in 
        <xref ref="fig-archim1"/>, and then he noticed that the hexagon's area is a rough estimate
        of the area of the circle. Let's work that out for ourselves. We can find the hexagon's area by dividing it into six equilateral triangles and finding
        their area. 
    </p>

    <question xml:id="ques-archim1">
        <title>The Hexagon's Area</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the area of one equilateral triangle using the formula <m>A = 1/2bh</m> for 
                base <m>b</m> and height <m>h</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The triangle is equilateral, so it has base length <m>1</m>. Using
                pythagorean theorem, we find the height to be <m>\sqrt{3}/2</m>. So the
                area of the triangle is <m>\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot 1 \cdot \left( \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.</m>
                So the area of the hexagon is <m>6 \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \approx 2.5980762</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>      
        
        
    </question>

    <p>
        Okay... that's not a great estimate for <m>\pi</m>, but Archimedes realized a
        dodecagon's area would be a better estimate. Why stop there though? he calculated areas of <m>24</m>-gons, 
        <m>48</m>-gons, and <m>96</m>-gons (all by hand and without modern trigonometry), all inscribed in a circle of radius 1. 
        Archimedes knew that these areas trend towards some number really close to what we now call <m>\pi</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the illustration below, you can see how the areas of <m>n</m>-gons trend towards <m>\pi</m> as
        <m>n</m> goes to <m>\infty</m>. Wait... that sounds like a limit! Archimedes build a limit that in 300 BC.
