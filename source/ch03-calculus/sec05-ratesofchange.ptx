<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

  <p>Did you know crows give gifts? Some people
    have found that if you routinely feed local crows or ravens, they 
    will eventually return the favor by bringing trinkets. People have reported
  that their crow friends have brought bottle caps, sticks, feathers, and miscelaneous
    shiny objects. </p>

  <!-- https://www.quora.com/Why-do-crows-sometimes-give-gifts-to-people-who-feed-them-Is-that-something-they-do-with-other-crows-If-so-why-->
    <p>
      Imagine your friend, Lucas, has a crow friend, and his crow brings him
      two small gifts a day. So the shoebox where Lucas keeps these gifts grows by
      two items a day. We can chart it like below.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-rates1">
      <caption>Crow-friend presents</caption>
      <image xml:id="image-rates1">
        <sageplot>
f(x) = 2*x
plot(f, (x, 0, 8), color='blue', thickness=3)
        </sageplot>
      </image>
    </figure>
    
  <p>
    We see here an example of linear data. That is, if we chart this information,
    we can see a straight line with equation <m>y = mx + b</m>, where <m>b</m> is 
    our initial amount (or <m>y</m>-intercept) and <m>m</m> is our slope.
  </p>

  <p>
    What does <term>slope</term> mean exactly? The graph in <xref ref="fig-rates1"/> 
    is <m>y = 2x</m>, and so the slope is <m>2</m>. But what does that mean? The
    slope refers to how quickly our line is changing... a <term>rate of change</term>. 
    In this case, <m>m = 2</m> gifts per day. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This is exactly why the slope formula is 
    <me>m = \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \text{ with points } (x_1,y_1) \text{ and } (x_2,y_2).</me>
    The rate of change is measured by "change in <m>y</m> over change in <m>x</m>".
  </p>
</subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-throwaball">
    <title>Throwing a Ball</title>
    <p>
      A lot of situations aren't linear, though, right? For example, if our <m>6ft</m> tall friend throws 
      a ball straight up at <m>30</m>mph (or <m>44</m> feet per second), thanks to gravity which accelerates over time, after
      <m>t</m> seconds, the ball is at height <m>s = -16t^2 + 44t + 6</m> feet.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-rates2">
      <caption>Ball height over time</caption>
      <image xml:id="image-rates2">
        <sageplot>
plot(-16*x^2+44*x+6, (0, 3), color='blue', linestyle='-', aspect_ratio=.06, thickness = 3)
        </sageplot>
      </image>
      
    </figure>

    <p>
      This obviously has a rate of change, but our slope formula doesn't seem
      to make sense anymore. So how do we find how quickly a ball is moving in the air at a given time? Unlike the
      crow-friend graph earlier, we cannot talk about slope... or maybe we should consider the slope to be variable. So when
      we talk about velocity, we have to talk about velocity <term>at a given time</term>, since velocity is not constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we want to know how fast the ball is travelling after <m>2s</m>. This is a difficult question at first, but 
      maybe we can take an average velocity over a short time interval and use this average velocity as an estimate for the
      velocity at exactly <m>2s</m>. For example, let's find the average velocity from <m>1.5s</m> to <m>2s</m>. In other words,
      we look for the slope of the line passing through the points <m>(1.5, s(1.5))</m> and <m>(2, s(2))</m>. We call such a line
      a <term>secant line</term>.
    </p>

      <title>Our First Average</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the slope formula to calculate the average velocity of te ball from <m>1.5s</m> to <m>2s</m>.

    <p>
      We can see the graph of the function modelling the ball and the secant line in <xref ref="fig-diff3"/>. The idea is that
      the slope of the secant line gives us an estimate for the rate the ball is travelling at <m>2s</m>. Is this a good estimate?
    </p>

    <p>
      Probably not.
    </p>

    <question xml:id="ques-der2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          How could we get a better estimate?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Maybe we should find secant line slopes that pass through points closer to <m>2s</m>,
          like the secant line corresponding to times <m>1.9s</m> and <m>2s</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
      
    </question>

    <p>
      If we take an average over a shorter distance, we can get a more accurate measurement for
      the instantaneous rate of change at <m>2s</m>. The Geogebra applet below shows the trend of slopes of
      the secant lines as our time interval gets smaller.

          It appears to be trending towards <m>20 ft/s</m>.

      </solution>
      
    </question>

    <p>
      Notice that the secant line disappears when the time interval is <m>0s</m>.
      This is part of the problem, right? We can get a trend of slopes when the time
      interval is close to <m>0</m>, but the slope formula is undefined once we have a
      time interval length <m>0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is, however, a special line we call the <term>tangent line</term> that intersects
      our graph right at <m>2</m> and whose slope <m>m</m> is the number that the secant slopes
      are trending towards. The tangent line's slope gives us the instantaneous rate of change
      that we are looking for. Wouldn't it be nice to have a good way of finding the tangent
      line's slope?

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-derivatives">
    <title>Derivatives and Instantaneous Rate of Change</title>
    
    
    <p>
      Remember from <xref ref="sec-harnessinf"/> that when we talk about trends, we're actually talking about limits.
      In this case, we're looking at slopes of secant lines as the time interval trends
      towards 0. This limit gives us the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> of a function at
      a given time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematically, with help of the slope formula, we could say the instantaneous rate
      of change is

      <me>\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \dfrac{s(x)-s(a)}{x-a},</me>

      and amazingly the simple slope formula we learned in algebra becomes the tool
      to finding instantaneous rate of change! 
    </p>

    <p>
      This limit is called the <term>derivative</term>, and it is the gateway to 
      understanding movement and change in mathematical terms. Your first semester of Calculus 
      will focus heavily on the derivative, including nice formulas for calculating
      derivatives and a variety of derivative applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, for function <m>f(x)</m>, we denote the derivative as <m>f'(x)</m>, and
      with this new definition, we see that the tangent line at <m>x = a</m> has equation
      <me>y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)</me> for any function. With the derivative in our arsenal,
      we have a more sophisticated method to finding a rate of change than using secant line.

      You encountere derivatives everywhere you go.... everytime you hit
      your car breaks... everytime you take medicine... and everytime you launch a rocket
      into space. The derivative is an extremely powerful tool. Let's look at a few applications
      of derivatives.

        <title>More Rates of Change</title>
        <p>
          We were not kidding around when we said that derivates are all around us.
          Any rate of change can be classified as a derivative. We can find examples from 
          biology, chemistry, population dynamics, ecology, economy, and astronomy (among many
          others).

        </p>

        <p>
          Let's look at an example.

              Suppose you have a tank holds <m>1000</m> gallons of water, which drains from
              the bottom in <m>60</m>min. By Torricelli's Law <!--https://www.britannica.com/science/Torricellis-law-->,
              the volume <m>V</m> of water remaining in the tank after <m>t</m> minutes is

        <p>
          If the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>0</m> at the value <m>x = a</m>, the instaneous rate of change at <m>x = a</m> is <m>0</m> as well. 
         That means the tangent line at <m>x = a</m> has slope <m>0</m> and thus is horizontal. What does this mean? When does a function
         have no change? Or a horizontal tangent line? Many times, these are the places where <m>f(x)</m> has either reached a high point or a low point. For this 
          reason, derivatives often help us find the highs and lows. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose we find <m>1600ft</m> 
          of fencing at a local flea market (for a price we can't turn down), and we are wanting
          to build an enclosed field with it. We have the perfect place along a local creek that will
          serve as one border of our field.
          The question calculus can help with is "How do we build a field with the most area possible?" Should
          this field be long and then? Should it be square shaped? Somewhere in between? Let's 
          figure that out.

        <p>
          We can label the rectangular sides as <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> (with <m>being the long side</m>), but
          we need to also setup equations for area and perimeter.

            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since one side of the rectangle is the creek, we have perimeter <m>p = 2x + y</m>, and
              so in total we have <m>1600 = 2x + y</m> as a representation of perimeter.

        <p>
          We can use our perimeter equation to express <m>A</m> as a one variable function. From there,
          the equation <m>A' = 0</m> will help us pinpoint exactly what dimension field has the maximum
          area.

            <p>
              We solve <m>1600 = 2x + y</m> for <m>y</m> to get <m>y = 1600 - 2x,</m>

          </solution>
          
        </question>

        <p>
          So now we know the area of a our field is <m>A(x) = 1600x - 2x^2</m>. After 
          some simple derivative rules, we obtain <m>A'(x) = 1600 - 4x</m>.
        </p>

        <question xml:id="ques-appd34">

              Solve the equation <m>A' = 0</m>.

          </statement>

          <solution>
            <p>
              We solve <m>1600 - 4x = 0</m> to get <m>x = 400</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
          
        </question>

        <p>
          So <m>x = 400</m> is a potential maximum or minimum of <m>A(x)</m>, and since
          <m>A(x)</m> is a downward opening parabola, it makes sense that <m>x = 400</m> is in fact
          the maximum. Putting it all together, the largest field we could possibly build has two sides length <m>x =400ft</m>
          and one more side length <m>y = 800ft</m>. The area of this field is <m>A = 400(800) = 320,000ft^2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can imagine there a lot of valuable applications similar to this.
