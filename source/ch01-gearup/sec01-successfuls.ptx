    How do you succeed as a math student? What does success even look like for a 
    mathematician? 
  </p>

  <p>
      College is a unique time to invest wholeheartedly in yourself. It is an enormous
      opportunity to build your skills, make valuable connections, and lay a foundation for
      your future. Even as a freshman, having a good plan for approaching your studies will make your
      life much, much easier.
    </p>

    <p> Before going too far towards your degree in mathematics, it is worth spending time considering how to be a successful mathematics student. 
      We will spend a few minutes now discussing a good strategy to making the most of your college tenure as a math student. </p>

        Think about people you know who are "good" at mathematics? What traits do they have
        that you feel made them "good" at mathematics?

      Now let's look towards the future. Ask yourself "What can I do to be a successful math student NOW?" 
      This is not always an easy question to answer, and honestly
      everyone will have to answer it differently.
      However, we can provide a few guiding points that may help you develop
      a strategy to do well in your mathematical coursework.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Be curious about things!</term> It is very difficult to learn about things if you have 
          no interest in them. We can practice curiosity (which leads to deeper learning) by simply asking
          "why" more often. Mathematics, especially, encourages us to wonder why things operate the way they do.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Don't just be a note taker!</term> Notes can be helpful, but do not think writing down whatever is 
          on the board is enough to have a good class. It is easy to take notes without thinking about what
          is actually happening in class.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Be alert in class.</term> Come to class ready to be engaged. Ask questions.
          You paid for the time. Don't waste it! 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Procrastination is NOT your friend.</term> It is easy to push off an assignment here or there to
          another time. Somedays are about balancing competing priorities, but in the long run procrastination will only make things worse.
          Avoid avoiding when possible.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Consistent work leads to consistent success.</term> Try to approach your 
          school work like you would a workout routine. Lifting weights once a week helps some, but
          if you are serious about bulking up, then you know you need to hit the gym more frequently 
          than once a week. Bring the same mindset, and with consistend work you will see gains in
          understanding and performance.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      People associate good math-ing with intelligence. There is some truth to that, but there are
      things we can do to increase our level of success. While we cannot control our intelligence, <term>Work ethic</term> 
      is in your control.

        If you are in a mathematics course this semester, make a plan to your approach to the course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask yourself the following questions:
        <ol>
          <li>

      <p>
        Find four classmates in your class that you have not met before. Ask them the 
        following questions:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is you name?

          <li>
            <p>
              What is your major?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

      <p>
        Finish your introduction with each person by picking a unique codeword to share
        just between the two of you. Example: "truncated".
