    <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
  What can you do with your degree? What doors does a background in mathematics open? What is a mathematician?
  You can be a math teacher, but what if you're not interested in education as a career?
  </p>

  <p>
  It's good to be thinking of life after college, even if you just started your college days. A little research into what
  career options are open to you will help set a vision for your future, and a vision for the future will
  provide a path of clear steps to get you there.

    Also remember that a huge part of the college experience is exploring options and
    figuring out what path fits you best. Do not feel pressured to have everything figured
    out yet. Here we are simply showing what's out here.

        Some of us are destined for more school than others. You might find yourself wanting more math than
        what your undergrad experience can accommodate. It could be that you decide to earn a Master's or a PhD.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have any interest in graduate school, you'll want to make sure to build a resume of things
        graudate programs look for.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              high GPA

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              interest in research (conferences, posters, thesis)

          <li>
            <p>
              a Research Experience for Undergrads (REU) if possible.
